# Scripts for Custom Ubuntu
used to create my own Ubuntu distro. use this as you want. if they work...

you'll need a iso renamed to orginal in the same folder to start.
you should execute those scripts in the order of the numbers asigned to them.

When I finally manage to make a bootable ISO, the version number of the last commit will be bigger than 0.1.X
