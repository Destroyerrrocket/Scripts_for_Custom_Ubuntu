# Scripts for Custom Ubuntu
used to create my own Ubuntu distro. use this as you want. if they work...

you'll need a iso renamed to orginal in the same folder to start.
you should execute those scripts in the order of the numbers asigned to them.

[Day 20/11/2017 00:00:00]: When I finally manage to make a **bootable ISO**, the version number of the last commit will be bigger than 0.1.X

[Day 25/11/2017 18:27:30]: I did it! I managed to make a **bootable ISO** from a Kubuntu 16.04.3 LTS ISO. If it manages to make a complete install, I think it will be safe to say that we succeed!
